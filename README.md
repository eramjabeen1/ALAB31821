# Single Mom CEO | Legacy Express App

This project was originally built as part of ALAB 318.2.1 — Building an Express Application — and has grown into a meaningful, personal tech portfolio.

## Description

This is not a typical Express app. It's a personal, purpose-driven project that reflects my journey as a single mother learning to code while raising a family. The application includes interactive features, career resources, and real-world use of backend development fundamentals.

## Lab Requirements Covered

- Multiple routes (`/`, `/about/:name`, `/submit`, `/download`)
- EJS as the view engine
- Public folder for static assets
- Dynamic routing (`/about/:name`)
- Form submission with POST (`/letter`)
- Downloadable file route (`/download`)
- Middleware (`app.use` logger)
- Styled layout with `style.css`
- Modular views + partials (navbar)

## Features

### `/explore`
An interactive tech career path guide for beginners and those exploring entry-level roles.

### `/letter`
A personal Legacy Letter feature where users can write and submit a message to their kids or future selves.

### `/starter-pack`
An animated checklist highlighting the steps I'm taking to build a career and legacy in tech.

This project is part of a growing portfolio that represents my skills, values, and future goals.

## Why I Share My Story

I proudly include “single mom” in this project not to be overly personal, but because it’s part of my story and strength. This isn't just a portfolio — it’s a reflection of real life, real effort, and real purpose.

Balancing coding, parenting, healing, and rebuilding is not a weakness .. it’s a superpower. I want other mothers, especially single mothers, to know that their experience belongs in tech too.

Sharing this part of myself is a reminder that our journeys matter. This app isn’t just about code — it’s about legacy.
